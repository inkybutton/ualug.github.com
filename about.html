</header>

<p>To quote from the original UALUG website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UALUG was founded on January 2007. Our mission is "to provide Linux tutorials, installfests, and support at the University of Auckland". Activities focus on introducing students to Linux and will parallel skills needed in University courses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In late June 2008, Sigrid Roehling, the original founder, stepped back as UALUG Coordinator after 18 months apparently (I wasn't there) filled with fun and awesomeness. Even though I wasn't present at the time, and probably didn't think I'd ever be writing this, I feel moved and enthused by the words in <a href="/2008/05/26/sigrid-stepping-back.html">that final, farewell note</a>.</p>

<p>Kennedy took over, or something like that. If I read the little information available, the core UALUG group in 2008 was comprised of Sigrid, Toby, Emlyn, Simon, Kennedy, and Barry. In <a href="/2009/09/02/new-site.html">September 2009</a>, Kennedy installed a new website and there seems to have been increased activity from then on.</p>

<p>From the <a href="/2010/05/24/meeting-minutes.html">minutes of a 2010 meeting</a> I can deduce a few of the members: Nevyn, Rob Connoly, Noel Zeng, Tony, Kennedy, Louis, Jan, Jamie. In 2011, Noel Zeng took over as Coordinator, and has been ever since.</p>

<p>I have no idea who were most of these people above, but I'd like to thank them for creating and maintaining UALUG in the years before. Our community might be small (less than 20 regular members on good days), it might be strange in its make up (containing an AUT student, a high-schooler, a guy in his... later years, working at Auckland Transport, and a few other anomalies), it might talk most on IRC and not much in meat-space, it might be divided in ideas and in philosophies. But it is us. And we are it. It's a community to belong to, to engage with, to feel at home in a place that might not have been ours to begin with.</p>

<p>We are UALUG, and we welcome you.</p>
