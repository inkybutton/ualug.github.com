  <h1><a href="/join.html">Love Free and Open Source Software? Join Us!</a></h1>
</header>

<p>The UALUG community is open to everyone from <a href="http://www.auckland.ac.nz">University of Auckland</a> interested in free and open source software. We have an active online presence in several places. You can also come to our real life meetings which tend to be announced on this site, the mailing list as well as our Facebook page.
<h2>IRC Channel</h2>
<p>Our IRC channel is very active throughout the day (and night) and you're welcome to drop in for a chat!</p>
<p>It's simple to join in with the web IRC client: just click on the IRC icon on the top-right, enter a CAPTCHA to verify you're not a robot, and you're in!</p>
<p> If you wish to use your own IRC client, you should use <em>irc.freenode.net on port 6667</em> as the server, and join <em>#ualug</em>.</p>
<h2>GitHub </h2> 
<p>Our <a href="http://github.com/ualug">GitHub organisation page</a> contains a list of projects we collaborate on, including this site. You can join the organisation and work on the projects by sending any of the public members an email, or ask in the IRC channel. By default, your GitHub activity stream (including activities on non-UALUG projects) will be published on this website's front page. If you don't want this to happen, please specify this when joining.</p> 
 <h2>Mailing List</h2>
<p>Visit and subscribe to <a href="https://nzoss.onlinegroups.net/groups/ualug">our mailing list</a>, and you will receive announcements of our upcoming meetings, and join in our discussions!</p>
