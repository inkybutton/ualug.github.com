Hi all,

I don’t think this has come up on the UALUG mailing list, so I thought I would post it here:  
There’s an Installfest coming up this Saturday, 12th of February at Tangleball.

You can come and install or try out a GNU/Linux distribution on your laptop, or bring a USB stick of sufficient size (usually 1GB or more will do) and get a copy of a distribution. We’ll help out if you come across any problems.

Time: **Saturday 12 February**, from **11am to 3pm**.
Place: **Tangleball**, 27 Edinburgh street, Newton, Auckland
