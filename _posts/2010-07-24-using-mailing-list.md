#### This post is an archive cross-post from the old UALUG website. Links might be broken.

As some of you already know, our mailing list is the main way we communicate. We use it to plan meetings, organise events, and to ask each other for help and advice.

So far, everybody who’s become involved in the LUG has already been comfortable with mailing lists. However, with the stall running for Re-O week, we will hopefully be attracting a lot of new members – members who may or may not have used a list like ours before.

With that in mind, here’s a short guide on using our list. You can either access it via forum or email. Both will reach the same people, so use whatever you feel most comfortable with.

Method 1: [The Forum][1]
------------------------

While I’ve said that we use a mailing list to communicate, over 6 months ago we decided to make it more accessible by putting a forum ontop of it. Basically, if you don’t want to receive emails for every post, you can use the forum instead.  You will get all the same information, all the same people will receive your posts, but you won’t have to clutter up your inbox.

To sign up, click the register link in the top right corner. You won’t be able to post unless you have an account with nabble, unfortunately.

Put in your email address, a password for logging into the forums, and a username… And that’s it! Check your emails for a confirmation link and you can log in and participate.


Method 2: Sign up for emails
----------------------------

This is the traditional mailing list way. If you’d like to send and receive emails of the discussion instead of visiting a webpage, sign your email address up to [the mailing list][2].

Just put in your email and name, then click the confirmation link in the email you will receive. After that, to start a new thread, you can send an email to <ualug@linux.net.nz>, or to reply to any mail you receive in an existing thread, just reply like any normal email.

If you wish to contribute rather than just reading the list, we **do not** recommend signing up to digest mode, as it will make it much more difficult for you to reply to individual threads.
