Hello UALUG, my name is Kennedy and I’m your new webmaster.

As you’ve probably noticed, the old website is gone and a new one has taken its place. We’re still ironing out the creases moving information over and we desperately need new content – tips, articles, reviews, logos, designs – everything’s up in the air right now so if you have ideas, please, [submit](http://groups.google.com/group/ualug) them!

In the meantime, here’s a quick rundown of what’s changed:

    We now have our own VM for the website. The particular advantage of this is that we can host our own services such as forums & a wiki. We’re not hosting them yet, but watch this space.
    The website is now powered by [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/). This should make maintaining and adding content rather trivial and allow for greater contribution from LUG members using the builtin permissions hierarchy.
    The old mailing list has sort of been shafted in favour of a [google group](http://groups.google.com/group/ualug?pli=1). This is where most of the discussion is taking place right now so check it out.

A copy of the old static site is being hosted [here](https://ualug.ece.auckland.ac.nz/old-website/) while everything gets sorted.
