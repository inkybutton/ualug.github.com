Hi everyone, this post is to announce details of the meeting next week.

This will be a casual meet and greet for new, old, and prospective LUG members to get to know each other. We may also discuss ideas for events to hold in the next few weeks.

If you havenâ€™t come to a UALUG meeting before, this is a perfect place to start!
