OWASP New Zealand's annual OWASP Day conference is coming up at the end of the month. As part of this conference OWASP is hosting training sessions including "Test Driven Development" , a half day training session where you will learn how to integrate security checks into your test cases. This will be of special interest to ruby developers who care about high quality and secure code.

Training sessions will be held on the 30th of August at The University of Auckland Business School. Spaces are limited and registrations close on the 20th of August (that's very soon). More information and registration details can be found [here](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2012#Training).

[OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/New_Zealand) (Open Web Application Security Project) is a international not for profit organisation with the goal of providing high quality information about mobile and web application security. OWASP has chapters in both Auckland and Wellington and regularly hosts free informal events where you can learn about application security.
