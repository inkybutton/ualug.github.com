Hello everyone!
Welcome to another year of university and UALUG.

It's time for an annual general meeting! It would be an excellent way to
catch up with everyone and decide on some Important Things. This is the
first meeting of 2013, and it will be at the Engineering Cafe, on 11 April
Thursday 2 - 3pm.

It is election time for the positions of president, secretary and
treasurer. All members are welcome to nominate themselves to any (or all)
of the positions by replying to this post, or offer yourself during the
meeting.

I will be stepping down this year, as I will be graduating by the end of
semester one. I will talk more about it during the meeting.

Here is the proposed agenda.

1. President's Report. (estimated 5 - 10 minutes)

2. Motion to (re)affiliate UALUG with AUSA. (estimated 5 - 10 minutes)

3. Election of president, secretary and treasurer.

4. General business - meetings,events planning/brainstorming.

Minutes will be posted on this site.

Cheers,

Noel.
