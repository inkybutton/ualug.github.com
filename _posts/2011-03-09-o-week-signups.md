… we lost them. Sorry guys! If you signed up to our stall on Wednesday or Friday, please send them to me at szen012 [AT] aucklanduni.ac.nz – replace [AT] with the email at sign. You know the one. :)

On the good news side of things, I will be getting an email about our upcoming events out tonight. Stay tuned!
