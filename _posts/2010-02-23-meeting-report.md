Reporting time once again.

8 people were present in this meeting, with one special guest from AuckLUG and one new recruit. Here are the things that were discussed:

### AUSA Affiliation

Almost all information that we need is in our possession, we only need to organize it so that we can send an application to AUSA. Affiliations can be done online through the AUSA website.

### Proposed Activities

There were a lot of stuff proposed during the meeting, mostly focused around spreading the word out about FOSS and making it available for students. Suggestions include compiling a list of FOSS apps that can be used for different papers, approaching instructors to promote these FOSS apps as alternatives to students, and have an installfest/tech support session to provide students with hands-on learning. A more detailed report can be found on the file linked below.

### Publicity

A logo is now in the works. Posters will then be drafted out once the logo is finalized. This is to improve our visibility around campus so that the students know weâ€™re here.
