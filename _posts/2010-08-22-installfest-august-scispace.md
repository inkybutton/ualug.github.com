Hi All,  
For those of you who are not following the mailing list, we will be having an installfest!

You can come and install or try out a GNU/Linux distribution on your laptop, or bring a USB stick of sufficient size (usually 1GB or more will do) and get a copy of a distribution. We’ll help out if you come across any problems.

Time: **Monday 23 – Thursday 26 August**, from **1pm to 4pm**.  
Place: **SciSpace**, Building 303, City Campus (see [map](http://www.sges.auckland.ac.nz/public/maps/city.pdf))

So come along, we won’t bite. :)
