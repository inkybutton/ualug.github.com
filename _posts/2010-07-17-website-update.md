Hello everybody, Kennedy the webmaster here.

It’s been a year since I first re-did the LUG website, and while this one is a good improvement on the old one, it’s in dire need of some work.

Today I will be uploading the new theme for the website. It’s a minor modification on what we’ve been using for the past year, but it should look a bit more streamlined and consistent.

I hope it’s at least a small improvement :)
