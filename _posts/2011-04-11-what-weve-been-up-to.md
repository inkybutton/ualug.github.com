Hello!
We’ve been quite busy lately! Here’s a summary of what we’ve been up to.

We’ve had weekly **social meetings** on Tuesdays 4pm, at the Albert Park band rotunda. Activities so far have included a game of Mafia, and a visit from Gary from Tangleball with his Reprap Machine.

**ITS Data Centre Tour** – we visited the impressive data centre that runs the University’s various applications and infrastructures, guided by the IT manager at the centre. Check out the photos in [our photo gallery](https://ualug.ece.auckland.ac.nz/photo-gallery?album=4).

There are more exciting activities coming up this semester! Sign up to our mailing list, join in our IRC channel, or follow us on Facebook and stay tuned – detailed instructions are on the [Community page](https://ualug.ece.auckland.ac.nz/community). We also need help! Go to the [Contribute page](https://ualug.ece.auckland.ac.nz/contribute) for stuff we could use a hand with, or just suggest a new idea. :)
