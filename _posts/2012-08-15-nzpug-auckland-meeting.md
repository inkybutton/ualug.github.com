There's a Python Meeting happening at Uni on the 15th! It will be held in [Eng3407/403-407][1] at 6:30PM. More details on [their meetup page][2].

> Tim McNamara will be talking about running Python in a distributed manner. He will be practicing his Kiwi PyCon talk, as well as providing a little bit more theory relating to the process of developing applications that span several, perhaps hundreds, of different machines. We'll be covering Celery and iPython's cluster management.
> 
> Guy Kloss will be leading a discussion about whether Auckland should put forward a bid for Kiwi PyCon 2013.
> 
> There will also be general merriment.
